    YtcFilter's original developer stopped development about a year
    ago, and YtcFilter was scheduled to be removed from the Chrome
    Web Store permanently in December 2022. However, we (the LiveTL dev team)
    have decided to inherit the project to revamp it!

  <li class="ml-3.5">
    YtcFilter has been rewritten from the ground up, and is now more
    powerful and robust than ever before. We hope you enjoy!
